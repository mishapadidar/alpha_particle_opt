### TODO:
- write up objectives and constraints
  - include the exponential energy loss 
- set up exponential energy loss objective
- set up new radial density
- determine if we can trace particles based on the passing-trapped boundary for hill climbing. 
  - Plot the passing-trapped boundary along poloidal slices
  - make 1d plots of particles which are far from the pt-boundary
  - if the plot is smoother, that is a good sign!
- determine if outer surfaces are more noisy than inner surfaces.
- determine if B field can be used for classifying particles
  - look at criteria based on modB.
- determine sample sizes required to dampen noise
- choose problems to solve with SAA and problems to directly handle randomness (BOBYQA, NOMAD, Snobfit, Turbo)
- set up optimization files for each problem
- set up a direct search method for SAA problems
- set up iterative increase of tmax.
- set up control variates and importance sampling
