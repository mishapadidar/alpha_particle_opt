## TODO:
- make the loss profile plot using the zenodo solutions.
- make 3d plots in paraview
- table second directional derivative in QS directions at config A.
- make hessian rescaling plot
- (maybe) make constraint sensitivity plot for config B.
- (optional) resolve the heck out of our two solutions using importance sampling.

- try variance reduction
  - importance sampling with gaussian in vpar
  - antithetics by reflecting theta,zeta over half-field period and using -vpar as starting condition.
- set up tracing in vmec coords
  - build 3d interpolation from vmec geometry function
  - improve the evaluation time of the guidingCenterRHS by using simsopt 3D interpolation.
  - test the particle tracing
