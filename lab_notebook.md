### TODO:
- post process optimization results
- set up variance reduction
  - importance sampling based on |B|: use |B| method from simsopt BoozerMagneticField class
  - set up and verify Matts classification of particles
  - backwards tracing, can do this in Boozer using simsopt methods.
  - control variates based on surfaces or shorter tracing or input variables.
- debug MPI errors
- correct sampling probability with jacobian.
  - perhaps we can just copy the routine from simple.
  - simsopt BoozerMagneticField class or BoozerRadialInterpolant have methods
    dRds, dRdtheta etc for derivatives of cylindrical w.r.t. Boozer coords.
- look at sensitivity to constraint and distribution parameters.
