## TODO:
- optimize to 4 modes tmax=1e-2
- set up a batch script for phase one
- set up dynamic resolution optimization in min energy
- generate starting points for many iota
- perform optimization over the range of iota.


## Long Term:
- set up tracing in vmec coords
  - finish writing the guiding center eqns
  - test the guiding center eqns
  - [x] generalize the stopping criteria
  - test the particle tracing

- set up a trace vmec module.
  - fix the comms in the guiding center tracing
  - set up concurrent evaluations for vmec tracing
  - develop gradient evals.

- set up gradient based optimization
- Build module to compute probabilities of theta,zeta.
- set up composite optimization with concurrent evaluations
