### Questions
- How do we compute curl(vpar b) in true guiding center equations?
- What is the correct mass and initial velocity (Ekin), charge?
- the velocity is constant so vperp varies right?
- what is the scale of the Bfield?
- why isnt VMEC always non-vacuum?

### TODO
- Develop Sela
- Build a Bfield from coils for the LandremanPaul configuration

### Sela improvements
- Use VMEC coordinates.
- Look into mass conservative methods through mass-consistent splitting.
- Use higher order interpolation (cascade interpolation?)
- Implement adjoint
- Implement GPU or MPI parallelism
