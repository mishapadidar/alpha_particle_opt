Our new configurations are 
``input.nfp4_QH_cold_high_res_phase_one_mirror_1.35_aspect_7.0_iota_-1.043``
``input.nfp4_QH_cold_high_res_phase_one_mirror_1.35_aspect_7.0_iota_1.043``
``input.nfp4_QH_cold_high_res_phase_one_mirror_1.35_aspect_7.0_iota_0.89``
The iota 1.043 and iota -1.043 are just mirror reflected versions of each other.
