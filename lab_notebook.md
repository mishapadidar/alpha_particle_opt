## TODO:
- set up gauss quadrature.
- do quasisymmetry optimization with aspect and mirror constraints.
- do optimization

- set up gradient based optimization with parallel finite differences.
- Build module to compute probabilities of theta,zeta.

- look over optimization results; maybe start opt with 4 modes

- use composite optimization

- post process results
  - out-of-sample performance
  - establish that our sols are minima.
  - comparison differences with quasisymmetry solutions.
    - compare to solutions optimized for quasisymmetry.
    - are these minima of confinement time.
    - plot E[confinement time] over trajectory of quasisymmetry optimization.
      to justify multimodality of E[confinement time]
  - physics analysis (Matt)
  - sensitivity to constraint and distribution parameters.
