### TODO
- Develop Sela in cylindrical coordinates
- Build a Bfield from coils for the LandremanPaul configuration
- Run a Tokomak test case with analytic solution.

### Sela improvements
- vectorize computations
- build a vtk writer for visualization.
- Use VMEC coordinates (Zernike polynomials?).
- Look into mass conservative methods.
- Use higher order interpolation (cascade interpolation, cubic by Ritchie)
- High resolution mesh around plasma boundary.
- Implement adjoint
- Implement GPU or MPI parallelism
