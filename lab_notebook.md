### TODO:
- write up objectives and constraints
- Plot the passing-trapped boundary
  - set up tracing on poloidal cross sections
  - plot each particles launch location for fixed s, in coordinates (theta,vpar)
  - color particles based on confinement time
  - try to determine the the boundary between passing and trapped particles
  - determine if we can use this as a classification method for hill climbing. i.e. only trace particles far from the passing-trapped boundary.
- set up new radial density
- choose problems to solve with SAA and problems to directly handle randomness
- set up optimization files for each problem
- set up a direct search method for SAA problems
- set up iterative increase of tmax.
- set up control variates and importance sampling
