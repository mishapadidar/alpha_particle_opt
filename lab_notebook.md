### TODO:
- write up objectives and constraints
  - include the exponential energy loss 
- set up new radial density
  - determine if we can use this as a classification method for hill climbing. i.e. only trace particles far from the passing-trapped boundary.
  - Plot the passing-trapped boundary along poloidal slices
  - Look at 1d plots for the subset of particles that are far from the boundary.
- choose problems to solve with SAA and problems to directly handle randomness (BOBYQA, NOMAD, Snobfit, Turbo)
- set up optimization files for each problem
- set up a direct search method for SAA problems
- set up iterative increase of tmax.
- set up control variates and importance sampling
