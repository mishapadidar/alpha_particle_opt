``optimize.py`` runs the optimization. This can be run with mpiexec when the ``debug`` flag is set to True.
``batch_submit.sh`` submits batches of optimization jobs to the slurm cluster.
``eval_config.py`` can be used to evaluate an optimized configuration. This is useful for
generating a wout file for plotting.
``plot_notebook.ipynb`` can plot the pickle data from the optimization.
