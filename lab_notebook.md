## TODO:
- do optimization with cobyla
- set up gradient based optimization

- Build module to compute probabilities of theta,zeta.
- set up composite optimization with concurrent evaluations

- post process results
  - out-of-sample performance
  - establish that our sols are minima.
  - comparison differences with quasisymmetry solutions.
    - compare to solutions optimized for quasisymmetry.
    - are these minima of confinement time.
    - plot E[confinement time] over trajectory of quasisymmetry optimization.
      to justify multimodality of E[confinement time]
  - physics analysis (Matt)
  - sensitivity to constraint and distribution parameters.
