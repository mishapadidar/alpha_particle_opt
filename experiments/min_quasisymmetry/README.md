Optimize for Quasisymmetry. This is mostly useful to generate configurations to compare against.

`optimize.py` performs the optimization using simsopt.

`post_process.py` performs particle tracing on configurations.

`eval_config.py`  can be used to evaluate a configuration. This is useful for creating a .wout file.

`batch_submit.sh` submits the optimization script to SLURM.
